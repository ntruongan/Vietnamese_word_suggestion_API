OLDER TED:

2
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,211
Back in 2009,

3
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,211
your Aunt Robin

4
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,005
got a job hosting

5
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,005
a morning show.

6
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,966
Which meant she had to get up

7
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,966
kind of early. How early?

8
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,345
Morning, everybody.

9
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,638
Hey!

10
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,889
MARSHALL:

11
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,889
Hey, Robin!

12
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,557
So you're actually doing it,

13
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,557
huh?

14
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,351
You're

15
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,351
actually going

16
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,351
to work at 2:00 a.m.

17
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,270
Okay, I'm not

18
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,270
doing it for me.

19
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,270
I'm doing it for the fans.

20
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,858
Who exactly are the fans

21
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,858
of a show that airs at

22
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,858
4:00 in the morning?

23
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,109
People getting

24
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,109
up to host a show

25
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,109
at 5:00 in the morning?

26
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,820
Ha, ha, ha.

27
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,446
Meth addicts who haven't

28
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,446
sold their TVs yet?

29
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,240
Strippers in

30
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,240
that messy gray area

31
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,240
between getting off work

32
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,368
and getting their

33
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,368
kids up for school?

34
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,537
Them's my peeps.

35
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,537
All right, catch me up.

36
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,997
What's been going on?

37
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,374
You know,

38
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,374
just the uzhe.

39
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,584
Really, the uzhe?

40
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,584
Yes.

41
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,880
Robin, think

42
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,880
of the funniest thing

43
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,880
that has ever happened.

44
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,757
Got it.

45
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,757
Now double that.

46
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,301
So, a chimpanzee

47
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,301
wearing two tuxedos?

48
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,094
(LAUGHS)

49
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,557
Something

50
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,557
even funnier than that

51
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,557
happened to Marshall today.

52
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,142
Okay,

53
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,142
first of all, there's

54
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,142
nothing funnier than that.

55
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,646
Second of all, look,

56
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,646
it's not that good

57
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,646
a story.

58
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,231
Oh, come on, you guys.

59
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,191
You're four young,

60
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,191
active people living

61
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,443
in the

62
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,443
most exciting

63
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,443
city on Earth.

64
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,362
You're telling me you

65
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,362
have no stories for me?

66
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,447
What can I say? Some

67
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,447
weeks are just like that.

68
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,034
It's the

69
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,034
same thing

70
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,034
over and over.

71
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,327
A kid

72
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,327
in my class

73
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,327
ate some paste.

74
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,749
I used deceitful

75
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,749
means to hook up with

76
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,749
a less-than-intelligent girl.

77
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,542
My ex-girlfriend,

78
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,542
Karen, moved to town.

79
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,084
It's just...

80
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,084
It's all the

81
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,084
same, Robin.

82
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,962
Karen's in town?

83
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,297
You have got

84
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,297
to be kidding me!

85
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,297
No!

86
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,717
OLDER TED: Kids, I think

87
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,717
I've told you about Karen.

88
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,510
She was

89
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,510
my girlfriend

90
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,510
in high school

91
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,429
and

92
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,429
intermittently

93
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,429
during college.

94
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,391
She was beautiful, smart.

95
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,391
I was madly in love with

96
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,391
her.

97
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,853
The only problem was,

98
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,853
Marshall and Lily

99
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,853
were not.

100
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,856
I think it had something to

101
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,856
do with every time Karen

102
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,856
opened her mouth.

103
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,816
I love that you

104
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,816
guys live in a dorm.

105
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,735
It's so American.

106
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,154
It's like,

107
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,154
"Let's all eat baloney

108
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,154
sandwiches and be racist."

109
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,242
Oh, my God, she

110
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,242
was such a douche.

111
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,369
Dude, she was the heiress

112
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,369
to the Massengill fortune.

113
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,662
(BOTH LAUGHING)

114
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,372
She really wasn't that bad.

115
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,083
Of course,

116
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,083
you think that.

117
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,127
She turned you into

118
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,127
one of her douche

119
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,127
zombies.

120
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:13,425
"I want to

121
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:13,425
eat your brain, but only if

122
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:13,425
it's organic and grass-fed."

123
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,552
What?

124
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,971
Will you pass the salt?

125
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,347
Salt?

126
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,349
So bourgeois.

127
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,393
Totally.

128
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,148
What's that thing?

129
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,985
That's a TV, Karen.

130
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,360
Oh.

131
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,738
I don't watch TV.

132
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,658
Totally.

133
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,828
You thought

134
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,828
I actually bought

135
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,828
tickets to WrestleMania?

136
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,080
I was being ironic.

137
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,499
Totally.

138
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,168
I know that you

139
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,168
were being ironic.

140
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,424
I, too, am being ironic.

141
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,718
Let's do this!

142
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,014
What?

143
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,307
That makeup didn't

144
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,307
come off for a month.

145
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,976
I had to meet

146
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,976
Lily's parents that way.

147
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,477
I've never looked

148
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,477
like a bigger jackass.

149
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,395
Until today.

150
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,356
Tell the story.

151
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,356
Tell the story.

152
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,356
Tell the story.

153
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,858
Just let it go!

154
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,152
Well, hold on.

155
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,152
Is it really funny?

156
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,821
Robin,

157
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,821
I am not kidding you.

158
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,614
I almost don't

159
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,614
want you to hear it,

160
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,660
because seriously,

161
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,660
for the rest of

162
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,660
your life,

163
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,497
nothing else

164
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,497
will ever be as funny,

165
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,497
and you will curse yourself

166
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,667
for agreeing

167
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,667
to ever hear it

168
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,667
in the first place.

169
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,960
But seriously,

170
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,960
you got to hear it.

171
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,378
It's so funny.

172
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,964
(SIGHS) Fine.

173
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,633
MARSHALL: I was

174
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,633
at the company gym this

175
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,633
morning playing basketball.

176
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,179
Now, the guys I work with

177
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,179
can be pretty brutal

178
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,179
with their ridicule.

179
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,640
Hey, look at Wisniewski.

180
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,640
He's gonna cry. Look at him.

181
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,100
(LAUGHING)

182
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,100
Yeah, look at him.

183
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,601
I don't know.

184
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,978
I don't think knees are

185
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,978
supposed to bend that way.

186
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,147
I think he might

187
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,147
have torn his ACL.

188
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,400
Bro, the only thing that guy

189
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,400
tore was his cervix or

190
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,400
maybe his hymen.

191
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,903
Yeah, or his Fallopian tubes.

192
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,903
Boom!

193
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,530
(BOTH LAUGHING)

194
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,033
I may

195
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,033
have cleaned up

196
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,033
the dialog a little bit.

197
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,661
Anyways,

198
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,661
I go to my duffle bag

199
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,661
to get out my work clothes...

200
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,747
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

201
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,082
I want to say it.

202
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,082
I want to say it.

203
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,082
I want to say it.

204
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,917
Fine. You say it.

205
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:14,129
Marshall goes to his

206
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:14,129
duffle bag to get out

207
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:14,129
his work clothes and...

208
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,882
No, no, no, you say it.

209
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,882
It's funnier if you say it.

210
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,551
No, let me say it.

211
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,551
No, no, you say it.

212
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,386
You say it. Say it.

213
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,680
Same time.

214
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,015
No, no, no, you go.

215
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,015
You go.

216
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,518
I forgot...

217
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,518
Marshall forgot his pants!

218
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,811
(LAUGHING)

219
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,405
He forgot his pants.

220
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,926
Okay, Marshall

221
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,926
forgot his pants.

222
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,926
That's pretty funny.

223
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,804
It's no chimpanzee

224
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,804
wearing two tuxedos.

225
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,472
(LAUGHING) I mean,

226
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,472
what did he...

227
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,182
He forgot he put

228
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,182
the first one on?

229
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,270
Stupid monkey.

230
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,731
So Karen

231
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,731
in New York.

232
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,731
Weird, right?

233
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,358
Ted,

234
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,358
you cannot get back

235
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,358
together with Karen.

236
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,153
I never said

237
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,153
I was going to get

238
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,153
back together with her.

239
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,196
But

240
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,196
I was thinking,

241
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,196
she's new in town.

242
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,198
Would it be the worst thing

243
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,198
in the world if I gave her

244
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,198
a call?

245
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,492
No, no, Ted, it wouldn't be

246
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,492
the worst thing in the world.

247
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,495
It would be

248
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,495
the fourth worst thing.

249
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,495
Number one, super volcano.

250
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,205
Number two,

251
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,205
an asteroid

252
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,205
hits the Earth.

253
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,373
Number three,

254
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,373
all footage of

255
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,373
Evel Knievel is lost.

256
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,709
Number four,

257
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,709
Ted calls Karen.

258
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,711
Number five, Lily

259
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,711
gets eaten by a shark.

260
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,132
I'm Lily and I approve

261
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,132
the order of that list.

262
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,092
You don't know

263
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,092
the whole story.

264
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,178
Ted and Karen were

265
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,178
off-and-on all through

266
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,014
college,

267
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,014
and it always

268
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,014
went the same way.

269
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,391
They'd be having fun,

270
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,391
douching it up, and

271
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,391
then one day...

272
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,227
I know you think

273
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,227
pepperoni is fascist,

274
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,146
and

275
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,146
you're totally

276
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,146
right, so I...

277
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,106
Oh, my God! Karen!

278
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,398
(SNIFFS)

279
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,609
Sorry, bro.

280
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,069
Before you say anything,

281
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,113
I think that

282
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,113
you should read

283
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,739
Baudelaire's

284
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,739
Les Fleurs du Mal.

285
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,493
Okay.

286
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,206
So then they break up.

287
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,791
Ted would be all

288
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,791
depressed and we would wait

289
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,791
the appropriate amount of time

290
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,252
and then

291
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,252
we would tell him

292
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,252
how we really felt.

293
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,419
Karen and I broke up.

294
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,965
We hated her!

295
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,965
Bitch had to go!

296
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,343
And then Ted would

297
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,343
build up a head of

298
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,343
steam

299
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:28,555
and finally take the bus to

300
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:28,555
Providence to give Karen

301
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:28,555
a piece of his mind.

302
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,351
How'd it go?

303
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,351
Great.

304
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,144
Look who's back!

305
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,523
Karen!

306
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,523
Karen!

307
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:43,570
And then, sure enough,

308
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:43,570
the whole thing would

309
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:43,570
start all over again.

310
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,950
Make that 10,002 Maniacs,

311
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,950
because I got us Natalie

312
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,950
Merchant...

313
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,202
(SNIFFS)

314
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,620
Sorry, bro.

315
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,749
So she would come visit you

316
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,749
at school and the second

317
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,749
you turned your back,

318
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,210
she would bring guys

319
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,210
back to your dorm room?

320
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,418
Respect.

321
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,338
Okay, I was an idiot.

322
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,965
She was

323
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,965
my first real girlfriend.

324
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,965
I was madly in love with her.

325
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,551
We all did stuff

326
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,551
we regret in college.

327
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,930
Junior year, Marshall grew

328
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,930
a soul patch, wore a Rasta

329
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,930
hat,

330
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,724
and asked everyone to

331
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,724
call him M.J. Smooth.

332
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,476
I don't regret

333
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,476
that for one second.

334
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,562
So you guys absolutely

335
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,562
don't think I should

336
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,562
call her?

337
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,855
ROBIN: Ted, no!

338
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,855
Of course not!

339
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,107
Get it through

340
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,107
your thick skull!

341
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,984
Okay, okay, fine, I won't.

342
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,445
Interesting piece of trivia,

343
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,445
I called her.

344
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,780
What are you doing?

345
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,780
You idiot!

346
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,198
Finish the pants story.

347
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,284
I can't believe

348
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,284
you called her.

349
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,911
Why don't you just ask her

350
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,911
to lunch while you're at it?

351
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:38,125
Because, Lily, I'm not going

352
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:38,125
to ask her out to lunch,

353
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:38,125
again.

354
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,544
Wow.

355
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,544
You asked her to lunch?

356
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,173
Why would anyone want to

357
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,173
have lunch with their ex?

358
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,633
Glad you asked, Marshall.

359
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,969
There are four

360
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,969
possible motives

361
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,969
behind an ex lunch.

362
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,471
Number one, they want

363
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,471
to get back together.

364
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,807
Oh. Like my high

365
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,807
school boyfriend,

366
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,807
Scooter.

367
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,060
Lilies, clever.

368
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,438
I'm sorry

369
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,438
I don't have

370
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,438
a scooter for you.

371
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:03,608
(LAUGHS)

372
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:03,608
My God, that's funny!

373
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:03,608
I forgot how funny you are.

374
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,778
Where is that waiter?

375
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,447
Why? You like waiters?

376
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,074
I can be a waiter.

377
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:16,455
I'm going to be the greatest

378
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:16,455
waiter on this Earth, and

379
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:16,455
then you'll love me.

380
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,623
Number two,

381
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,623
they want to kill you.

382
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,792
Like when I had

383
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,792
lunch with Wendy.

384
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,044
I'm glad

385
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,044
we could finally do this.

386
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,464
You know,

387
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,464
after the ninth time

388
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,464
you rescheduled on me,

389
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,090
I almost gave up on you.

390
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,969
But you didn't.

391
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,969
You just kept on trying.

392
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,349
By the way, there's something

393
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,349
I've been meaning to give you.

394
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,561
Gun! She's got a gun!

395
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,066
(STAMMERING) It's a tie.

396
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,403
Number three,

397
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,403
they actually do want

398
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,403
to give you your stuff back.

399
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,613
Like when I had

400
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,613
lunch with Curt.

401
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,368
By the way, there's something

402
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,368
I've been meaning to give you.

403
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,289
(GASPS)

404
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,916
My snub-nose

405
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,916
.38 Police Special!

406
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,211
God, I knew

407
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,211
I left that

408
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,211
somewhere.

409
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,087
Every time I watch

410
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,087
the news, I'm like,

411
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,964
"Oops.

412
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,964
Hope that wasn't my gun."

413
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,799
(CHUCKLES)

414
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,261
Breaking up was

415
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,261
the right choice.

416
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,391
Or number four,

417
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,391
to rub your face in

418
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,391
how great they're doing.

419
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,976
Like

420
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,976
my lunch with

421
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,976
Nicole Barsamian.

422
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,269
Who's Nicole Barsamian?

423
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,562
My ex.

424
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,856
Hello, Nicole.

425
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,316
You look well, Marshall.

426
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,443
You look okay, I guess.

427
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,737
I'm seeing someone.

428
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,572
Already? Who?

429
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,575
Lee Roberts. He reads

430
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,575
at a fifth-grade level.

431
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,915
You have to

432
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,915
cancel the lunch.

433
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:47,212
I would definitely do that,

434
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:47,212
definitely, except I

435
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:47,212
already had it.

436
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,590
Robin, I'm going to need to

437
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,590
borrow the butt of your gun.

438
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,260
I actually

439
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,260
lost it again.

440
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,260
Can you believe that?

441
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,893
How could you break

442
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,893
bread with that woman?

443
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,355
It was just lunch, and you

444
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,355
know she doesn't eat wheat.

445
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
We had a great

446
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
time catching up.

447
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,151
I mean, we even laughed about

448
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,151
what jerks we were back then.

449
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,986
(LAUGHING)

450
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
I can't believe

451
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
I had a beret for

452
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
each day of the week.

453
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:19,369
I can't believe

454
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:19,369
I had an iron-on image

455
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:19,369
of Moliere on my backpack.

456
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,580
Man, we were pretentious.

457
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,998
So pretentious.

458
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,666
What can I get you?

459
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,876
Hi.

460
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,462
(CLEARS THROAT)

461
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,338
I don't want

462
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,338
to cause a scene,

463
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,673
but

464
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,673
your wine list has

465
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,673
a Chateauneuf-du-Pape

466
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,302
listed under your

467
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,302
Cotes de Provence.

468
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,929
You might want to

469
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,929
alert your sommelier.

470
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,014
And for you?

471
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:44,852
I hate to go off-menu, but can

472
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:44,852
we have some bruschett with

473
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:44,852
fresh mozzarell?

474
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,354
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

475
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,941
It was great.

476
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,941
It was great.

477
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,527
I mean,

478
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,527
there was one weird

479
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,527
moment towards the end.

480
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,737
Yeah, I mean, how do

481
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,737
you say goodbye in

482
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,737
those situations?

483
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,364
A kiss

484
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,364
on the cheek

485
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,364
is too familiar.

486
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,907
A handshake

487
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,907
is too formal.

488
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,910
And a hug is just

489
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,910
like a public dry

490
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,910
hump.

491
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,747
I think

492
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,747
you're hugging wrong.

493
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,041
So what happened?

494
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,041
Well...

495
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:12,922
Schopenhauer made a saucy

496
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:12,922
little argument in which

497
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:12,922
he posited...

498
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,092
Ted, honey, I want you to go

499
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,092
outside and bite the curb.

500
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,092
I'll be out in a minute.

501
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,596
Hey,

502
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,596
Karen was the first

503
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,596
girl I ever loved. Okay?

504
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,557
And after the year I've

505
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,557
had, I... I don't know,

506
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,768
I guess having lunch with her

507
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,768
just reminded me of what it

508
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,768
was like to be 18

509
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,647
and have my whole

510
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,647
life figured out.

511
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,689
And I would like to

512
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,689
remind everyone that

513
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,026
at least I was

514
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,026
wearing pants,

515
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,026
Marshall.

516
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,986
No! No, no, no!

517
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,946
You can't

518
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,946
just go changing

519
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,946
the subject like that.

520
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,657
Oh. Yeah,

521
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,657
the pants story.

522
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,326
Pants story, bomaye!

523
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,326
Pants story, bomaye!

524
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,619
There's no story!

525
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,704
I had a little situation,

526
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,704
so I called Lily.

527
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,248
And just refresh us,

528
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,248
what was that situation?

529
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,916
I forgot my pants.

530

(GIGGLING)

531
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,504
What do you mean

532
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,504
you forgot your

533
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,504
pants?

534
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,005
I forgot them.

535
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,090
Now,

536
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,090
I need you to

537
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,090
bring me some.

538
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,884
What about your spare pants?

539
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,844
Last Thursday,

540
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,844
the mustard incident?

541
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,638
Jeez, woman, you have

542
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,638
the memory of a goldfish.

543
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,558
No, Ted, you're not

544
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,558
getting off that easy.

545
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,601
Marshall's pants story,

00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,601
while amusing...

547
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,563
Amusing?

548
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,563
Try very amusing.

549
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,608
...is nothing compared

550
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,608
to this Karen madness.

551
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,608
Finish your story.

552
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,903
What?

553
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,903
That's it. It was just

554
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,903
one kiss in the restaurant.

555
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,239
Why did you say

556
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,239
"in the restaurant"?

557
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,074
Did you kiss

558
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,074
somewhere else?

559
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,284
Like where, in a tree?

560
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,995
No,

561
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,995
Lily, we did not

562
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,995
make out in a tree.

563
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,122
What's with this one?

564
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,209
Oh, Ted.

565
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,209
What did you do?

566

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

567
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,884
Ted, how could you?

568
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,388
Ted, Marshall forgot to

569
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,388
bring his pants to work

570
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,388
today,

571
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,558
and you're

572
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,558
still the stupidest

person at this table.

574
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,518
Okay, Lily,

575
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,518
let's be honest.

576
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,478
We both know your

577
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,478
real motivation here.

578
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,274
You hate Karen

579
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,274
because she lingered.

580
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,276
You son of a bitch.

581
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,569
What do you mean

582
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,569
she lingered?

583
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,948
February 5th, 1998.

584
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,948
I was painting...

585
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,413
Sorry.

586
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,413
I... Sorry. I...

587
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:17,171
You know, that color palette

588
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:17,171

don't you think?

00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,844
Cheat on Ted,

594
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,972
whatever,

595
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,972
that's your business.

596
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:31,519

The game is the game.

In Karen's defense,

602
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,695
I had just worked out.

603
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,739
Why'd

604
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,739
you have to paint

605
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,739
Marshall nude anyway?

606
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,949
Because he ate

607
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,949
my bowl of fruit.

608
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,036
Look, the point is,

609
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,036
Karen is a dirty

lingerer,

611
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,331
and you

00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,331
cannot bring her

00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,331
back into our lives.

Relax,

00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,041
it was just

616
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,041
that one night!

617
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,752
And the next

618
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,752
three after that.

619
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,752

622
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,631
I had pants on, Marshall.

623
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,132
Although, actually, I didn't.

624
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,550
Wait,

625
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,550
this happened

626
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,550
in our apartment?

627
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,885
Mmm-hmm.

628
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,885
Where was I?

00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,515

crazy new schedule?

00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,932
they're stronger

00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,348
to look back at a time

651
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,768
when you were

pretty embarrassing

00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,636

785
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,872
as you'll see on

786
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,872
page 44 of the contract...

787
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,082
Hey, Eriksen,

788
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,082
when did you

789
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,082
join AC/DC?

790
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,709
(ALL LAUGHING)

791
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,545
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

792
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,590
Now,

793
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,590
can we please just turn

794
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,590
to page 44 of the contract?

795
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,552
Hey, Eriksen,

796
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,552
I think the   Oliver Twist

797
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,552
auditions are down the hall!

798
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,768
Hey, Eriksen, "Please, sir,

799
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,768
may I have some more pants?"

800
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,403
More pants!

801
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,864
Oh, my God!

802
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,494
That's it?

803
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,494
That's the whole story?

804
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,746
So what happened with Karen?

805
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,915
I'll finish it for you.

806
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:48,044
Ted left without

807
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:48,044
saying anything and Karen

808
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:48,044
got exactly what she wanted.

809
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,713
Mmm-mmm.

810
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,713
Not this time.

811
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,173
So, you have a boyfriend?

812
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,926
We've been drifting

813
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,926
apart for a long time.

814
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,677
I've been meaning

815
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,677
to break up with him.

816
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,305
God, Karen,

817
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,305
you are unbelievable.

818
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,349
You don't have the guts to

819
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,349
break up with someone like

820
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,349
a decent human being,

821
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,351
so instead you

822
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,351
pull this crap.

823
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,855
Okay, you're right.

824
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:14,112
I'm great with books.

825
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:14,112
I'm great with art.

826
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,405
I'm great with identifying

827
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,405
French wines from within

828
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,405
a mile

829
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,993
of where the

830
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,993
grapes are grown.

831
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,161
But I'm really

832
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,161
bad when it comes to

833
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,161
looking someone in the eye

834
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,872
and telling them the

835
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,872
truth about how I feel.

836
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,542
Well, we're both bad at that.

837
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,879
But I think we

838
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,879
both need to change.

839
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,879
So why don't I go first?

840
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,050
Karen, you're a really

841
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,050
hurtful and reckless

842
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,050
person,

843
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,261
and I never

844
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,261
want to see you or

845
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,261
speak to you again.

846
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,264
Au revoir.

847
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,641
Ted, wait.

848
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:52,525
Actually,   "au revoir"  means

849
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:52,525
"until we see each other

850
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:52,525
again."

851
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:57,488
So, I'm assuming

852
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:57,488
that you mean we will

853
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:57,488
in fact see each other again?

854
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,240
(SNIFFS)

855
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,868
Sorry, bro.

856
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,287
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

857
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,622
Thank you. Thank you.

858
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,622
Yes!

859
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,708
Bravo.

860
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,708
Ted, I am impressed with you.

861
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,876
You, too, Marshall.

862
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,544
Have you been

863
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,544
wearing those

864
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,544
all day?

865
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,088
They show off my calves.

866
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,008
Pants story.

867
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,008
Tell it again.

868
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:20,553
You know,

869
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:20,553
maybe it was good

870
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:20,553
you called Karen.

871
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,472
It definitely was. And not

872
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,472
just for me, but for her, too.

873
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,599
Later that night,

874
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,599
she sat down with Jerry,

875
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,686
and she had

876
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,686
the break-up talk she

877
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,686
always avoided with me.

878
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,479
OLDER TED:

879
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,479
So you see, kids,

880
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,815
sometimes when

881
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,815
you have to have

882
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,815
a tough conversation,

883
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,983
the best thing to do...

884
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,444
Wait a second.

885
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,444
Wait a second.

886
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,489
You said you

887
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,489
were never gonna talk

888
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,489
to Karen again, right?

889
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,782
Yeah.

890
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,326
Then how do you know

891
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,326
she took your advice?

892
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,661
Hmm?

893
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,248
Oh! Right.

894
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,248
Well, about that.

895
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,375
After she

896
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,375
broke up with that dude,

897
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,375
she called me, we went out,

898
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,086
we hooked up,

899
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,086
and we've been

900
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,086
dating ever since.

901
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,503
We're really seeing

902
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,503
eye-to-eye, and this time,

903
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,755
I don't know, it just

904
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,755
feels different somehow.

905
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,924
Here she comes now.

906
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,924
Be cool! Hey!

907
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,760
ALL: (MUMBLING) Karen.
